      "Made using elm while working with McMaster University in my 2nd year. At that time, unlike React, Javascript, etc. there was no support and big community for elm and specifically for what I was trying to achieve. Usually had to read the documentation and personally find and reach out to people for any doubts. Big thanks to Andrey, Ian, Chris, Professor Anand and Professor Jagalingam for all the help and support.",

But in the journey I made some pretty cool landing pages for products",

And finally learnt about APIs, middlewares, headers, and all. I love using new APIs and creating SPAs in my free time. And finally I learnt about Firebase. It's sooooo dope.",

Whatever I know, I wanna share to those who don't, so that there are more people who understand what developers do, and can help each other out and become part of a bigger community. It's a new venture and I've mentioned the topics that I'll be blogging about. New blogs are out every sunday.",

Open source contributions helped me stay up-to-date with industry standards, taught me how to code collaboratively, needs and benefits of writing clean code, code refactoring, adding comments, best practices and whatnot. It is a really good way to help amazing projects and meet even more more amazing developers",
